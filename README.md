# Requirement Analysis in Software Development


## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the final system meets the intended purpose.  

During this phase, business goals are translated into detailed functional and non-functional requirements, forming the foundation for design, development, and testing.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is important in the SDLC for several reasons:

1. **Clarity of Objectives**  
   It ensures that both stakeholders and developers share the same understanding of the project goals. Miscommunication at this stage can lead to costly errors later.

2. **Efficient Resource Use**  
   Clear requirements prevent scope creep and help allocate time, budget, and effort more effectively.

3. **Risk Reduction**  
   Identifying potential challenges early in the requirements phase reduces the chances of project failure or delays.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process of Requirement Analysis usually involves the following activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders, customers, and users.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to clarify and refine requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Writing clear, structured requirements in documents like SRS (Software Requirement Specification).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing feasibility, prioritizing needs, and representing requirements with models (e.g., use case diagrams).

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Verifying that the documented requirements meet stakeholder expectations and are feasible.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do â€” the core features and behavior.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**  
- Users can search for available rooms by date and type.  
- The system allows customers to book, modify, or cancel reservations.  
- Admins can generate booking and revenue reports.  

### Non-functional Requirements
These specify how the system should perform rather than what it should do.  

**Examples (Booking Management System):**  
- The system should handle up to 500 concurrent bookings without performance degradation.  
- All transactions must complete within 3 seconds.  
- The system must comply with GDPR data protection standards.

## Use Case Diagrams
**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help identify system boundaries and clarify functional requirements at a high level.  

**Benefits:**  
- Easy visualization of system behavior.  
- Helps stakeholders and developers align on scope.  
- Provides a starting point for detailed requirement specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They act as a checklist for validating requirements.  

**Importance:**  
- Ensures features meet business needs.  
- Guides testing and validation.  
- Reduces ambiguity in feature expectations.  

**Example (Checkout Feature in Booking Management System):**  
- The system must allow users to proceed to checkout only if a booking exists in the cart.  
- Payment must be processed securely via credit card or PayPal.  
- Confirmation email should be sent within 1 minute after successful payment.  
- If payment fails, the booking should not be confirmed, and the user must see an error message.
